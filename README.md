# pCloud Go client, for the rest of us

This is a pCloud client written in Go for cross-platform compatibility.

The first objective is to implement a Go version of the SDK.

NOTE: I'm not affiliated to pCloud so this project is as good or as bad as it gets.

## Documentation

The pCloud SDK is documented at:

https://docs.pcloud.com

## Getting started

The tests rely on the presence of two environment variables to supply your credentials:
- `GO_PCLOUD_USERNAME`
- `GO_PCLOUD_PASSWORD`
